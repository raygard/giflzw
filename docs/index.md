# giflzw

This is an _incremental_ encoder/decoder library for the GIF variant of LZW encoding.

This is not good for much other than GIF encoding/decoding; more modern compression libraries offer much better compression. I wrote this primarily to contribute to the Python Imaging Library (PIL/Pillow), but it can be used for any GIF encoding/decoding requirement.

The library, examples, demo and utility programs have been tested in Ubuntu Linux under WSL2 and in Windows 10 using the MinGW-W64 gcc compiler in 32-bit mode.

The source for the library, including these docs, is in <https://github.com/raygard/giflzw>.
